## Description

---
This project is entirely based on the [Steam Web API](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Steam_Web_API#JSON). You can find all the API information in the "all_api_info" folder, which includes both the APIs that require an API key and the ones that can be called without an API key. However, to ensure smooth usage, it is recommended that you [apply for an API key](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey). Currently, the project has only implemented a portion of the API functionalities that I deemed useful.
